**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

Not so much struggling, a little more of uncertain, and not having memorized the full procedure of add, commit, push, merge, pull.  Not a little more familiar with them.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

The workflow relating to pushing changes and merging between branches and master.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

Asked about checking on merge conflicts, best practices to avoid merge conflicts, how to pipe your past commands into a file, what's the procedure for merging pull requests to master.

**What still confuses you about git?**

I'm sure there are additional things I don't know yet. Like I'm a little uncertain of what happens if you create a file first, then a branch after.  Is it included in the branch?  I'll look that up.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

It was great.  A little uncertain at parts as you move along with someone you're working with for the first time, but the openness of everyone was key to moving thigns along, figuring out stuff collectively and keeping it fun.
