###What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I'm glad I was able to practice the process of making changes and keeping track of them. Just being able to go through the version control workflow was very helpful in getting the process down. I was also unsure of how to solve merge conflicts

###What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

What happens when there are conflicts with a branch and the remote repo.

###What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked about merge conflicts, best practices, and how to add commands used in the past into a file.

###What still confuses you about git?

Although I have a better understanding on how to resolve merge conflicts, I think I need more practice with it to get the concept down. I'm also not quite sure how to step back to previous versions, although I haven't had to do that yet.

###How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great. We were able to talk to each other in a loose, friendly manner. We both took turns driving and navigating. Our guide was awesome. She really helped us with getting some of the concepts down. I look forward to my next GPS.
